# Funny names for OpenXCom

This repository is to create a name pool for the game OpenXCom. It is open for viewer submissions!

Make a pull request or open an issue with your suggestions. Or alternatively, find me with your ideas on Mastodon at
https://distrotoot.com/@nicemicro or on YouTube under the following post: https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxuUwU5CBtYOTigS95ySoGTsMBOMP1dq2O

## How does it work?
The game generates random soldier names from this pool. First names and last names are always chosen from the same file
(no mixing between different files). The files contain male and female and first names, but only male last names, because
if the female last name part is missing, both genders will get their last names from the same pool. The game choses the
name randomly, but tries to always generate names that haven't occured before (including dead soldiers). If the randomly
chosen name is a female name, the soldier will get a female graphical representation, otherwise it gets a male one. In
game soldier statistics are gender neutral.

## How to contribute?
I have created files based on themes. historic.nam and techpeople.nam contains names from world history, computer science
and free software histoy and current events while scifi.nam contains names from sci-fi literature. Add your suggestions to
these, so your favorite historical figure / tech personality / sci-fi character will get into the random name pool! Or,
alternatively, you can suggest a new category with a new file, but in that case make sure to suggest at least 6 first and
6 last names.

We have a libresoft.nam file, which contains some Free Software related terms and memes. Help to improve that. Remember,
that the game engine can pair any first name with any last name from the same file, and it'd be nice if all possible
combinations would make some sense.

If you are a viewer / prospective viewer of the OpenXCom livestreams, and want your name randomly appear as a soldier name,
you should take a look at viewers.nam. The viewer nick names are added as last names, and first names are adjectives.
Remember, the more first names we have on the list, the higher the chance that a viewer name will appear as a random
soldier in the game! Add your favored nick name to the list, and suggest more positive adjectives for male and female
first names!
